## Introduction

Automated testing is essential for ensuring application reliability and efficiency. Combining the power of Pytest, VS Code, and Playwright, you can create robust end-to-end test suites. In this guide, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to automate a search functionality test for Google using a sample site and generate search questions dynamically with ChatGPT prompts.


## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1.Python (version 3.8 or higher)

2.Node.js (for installing Playwright)

3.VS Code (or any text editor of your choice)

4.Installed libraries:

  pytest
  
  pytest-playwright
  
  openai (for ChatGPT integration)

Install the necessary libraries with:

> pip install pytest pytest-playwright openai
> playwright install

## Setting Up the Environment

# 1. Initializing the Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

> mkdir pytest-playwright-chatgpt
> cd pytest-playwright-chatgpt

Initialize a Playwright project:

> playwright codegen

# 2. VS Code Extensions

Install these recommended VS Code extensions:

Python: For syntax highlighting and debugging.

Playwright Test for VS Code: To manage and run Playwright tests.

GitLens: For version control.

## Writing a Test with Playwright and Pytest

# 1. Creating the Test File

Create a file named test_google_search.py:

```python 
import pytest
from playwright.sync_api import Page
import openai

# OpenAI API key setup
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# ChatGPT prompt to generate search questions
def generate_search_queries(topic):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Generate 5 search queries about {topic}."}
        ]
    )
    return [message["content"] for message in response["choices"]]

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def page(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()
    yield page
    context.close()
    browser.close()

@pytest.mark.parametrize("search_query", generate_search_queries("climate change"))
def test_google_search(page: Page, search_query):
    # Open Google
    page.goto("https://www.google.com")

    # Accept cookies if prompted
    if page.locator("text=I agree").is_visible():
        page.locator("text=I agree").click()

    # Perform search
    page.fill("input[name='q']", search_query)
    page.press("input[name='q']", "Enter")

    # Verify results
    assert page.locator("#search").is_visible(), "Search results are not visible."
```

## Running the Tests

Execute your tests using Pytest:

> pytest test_google_search.py --headed

Add --headed to run the browser in non-headless mode.

View the test results in the terminal or integrate them into CI/CD pipelines for automated builds.

## Benefits of this Setup

# Pytest:

Simple syntax and detailed reports.

Highly extensible with plugins.

# Playwright:

Cross-browser testing with ease.

Supports modern web features.

# ChatGPT:

Dynamically generates test inputs for broader coverage.

Saves time and enhances creativity in test scenarios.

## Conclusion

Integrating Pytest, VS Code, and Playwright with ChatGPT empowers developers to automate application testing efficiently. The dynamic generation of test cases enhances the robustness of your test suite, ensuring thorough validation of your application. Start implementing this setup today and elevate your testing game!
